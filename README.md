This project made while I studied HTML5.After project9(p9.html) I started to use CSS in my projects.You can access this projects on HTML with CSS folder.
You find a Final_website folder in this folder and that is the my last project for HTML5 for now.
        <       --UPDATE--      >      
After this training I'd continue to learn CSS and at last I have learned how to do responsive web sites.As a result of this I made a website.If you want to look my website
